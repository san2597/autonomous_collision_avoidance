# Autonomous Bot with Collision avoidance

This repository contains a report of an autonomous bot project undertaken at IIITDM Kancheepuram as part of a course. 

The aim was to create an autonomous robot that can successfully navigate through waypoints previously set by the programmer while avoiding obstacles during the run. The bot used an on-board GPS to note its current position and calculated the shortest distance to the next waypoint at all possible times. 

Code available on-demand.
